# Google Drive Bulk Actions

Allows you to rename files in Google Drive in bulk.

## Usage

* Search and replace using plain text
* Search and replace using regular expressions
  * To use matched groups in your replacement use `$n`, where n is the number of the matched group
* Search and replace recursively in sub folders
  * If there are too many files/sub-folders the operation will timeout
